# Automatic File Sorter

This is a small program that automatically moves and sorts files from chosen source to destination.
It uses [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI) to create a minimal GUI for the program.

### NOTE: If you intend to clone and build the source yourself, you can use [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) to create an .exe file from the python script.
