# Automatic File Sorter

- This is a small program that automatically moves and sorts files from chosen source to destination. It uses [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI) to create a minimal GUI for the user.
- Anyone is welcome to work on it and add whatever features they wish, as long as they adhere to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Kreateer/automatic-file-sorter/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/Kreateer/automatic-file-sorter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## How to Contribute?

- First, refer to the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/Kreateer/automatic-file-sorter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Take a look at the existing Issues or create your own Issues to work on!
- Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you before you start working on it.
- Fork the repository and create a Branch for any Issue that you are working on.
- Create a Pull Request which will be promptly reviewed and suggestions might be added to improve it.
- Optional, but it would be helpful if you added screenshots to help everyone know how your fix or new feature works.

## Building/Compiling Into a Runnable Executable

- If you wish to build the source yourself and run the program from an executable instead of running the script everytime, you can use [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) to compile the script into an .exe file.
