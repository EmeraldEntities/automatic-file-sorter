- This is a small program that automatically moves and sorts files from chosen source to destination. It uses [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI) to create a minimal GUI for the user.
- Anyone is welcome to work on it and add whatever features they wish, as long as they adhere to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Kreateer/automatic-file-sorter/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/Kreateer/automatic-file-sorter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- This project is especially interesting **for Python beginners** who don't have a project idea, but would like to work on something or anyone participating in the annual **Hacktoberfest** and looking to contribute to a project.

## Project Goal(s) üéØ

This project aims to create a small, user-friendly tool to help people with organizing their files through use of simple algorithms that provide a number of sorting options.

Specifically, this project looks to provide the user with:

- A program that automatically moves/copies and sorts files from user-designated source to destination directory
- A user-friendly interface for managing files
- The option to automatically move/copy and sort files from removable devices
- The option to automatically sort directories or partitions as content is added, changed or removed

## How to Contribute? ‚úçÔ∏è

- First, refer to the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/Kreateer/automatic-file-sorter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Take a look at the existing Issues or create your own Issues to work on!
- Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you before you start working on it.
- Fork the repository and create a Branch for any Issue that you are working on.
- Create a Pull Request which will be promptly reviewed and suggestions might be added to improve it.
- Optional, but it would be helpful if you added screenshots to help everyone know how your fix or new feature works.

Otherwise, if you are **new to GitHub** or have **never contributed** to GH projects, you can refer to these **helpful guides** on how to contribute:

## Compiling Into Executable ‚öôÔ∏è

- If you wish to build the source yourself and run the program from an **executable** instead of running the script everytime, you can use [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) to compile the script into an **`.exe`** file.
